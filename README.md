# Data Structures and Algorithms I - Array and String Manipulation

This is the starter code for Computer Science - Sprint 2: Data Structures and Algorithms I - Module 1: Array and String Manipulation.

Please fork and clone this repo to your computer by the start of class.

Notes on string and arrays:

Good at:

1. Keeping track of the order of when things are added/removed
2. Indexing
3. Iterating
4. Sorting

Not good at:

1. Get rid of duplicates (only storing unique values)
2. Checking if something is an element in the array (using the 'in' keyword)
   - Has to iterate over every element in the array to check: 0(n) - linear
   - In contrast, dicts and sets will do this same operation in: 0(1) - constant

In-place vs Out-of-Place:

Space complexity: How much additional memory did you use?
In-place: Re-using memory
Out-of-Place: Allocating new memory to get something done
